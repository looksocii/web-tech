        <h1>WHAT IS A LOGO?</h1>
        <p>A logo is the graphic symbol that represents a person, company or organization. If the logo is well-known enough, such as the Nike swoosh, you may even see a logo used without the name of the business that it is associated with. Normally, most marks have a typographic part that more clearly spells out the name of the organization.</p>
        <h1>What is a wordmark or logotype?</h1>
        <p>A logo can also be purely typographic. It is called a logotype or wordmark when only the letters of the name make up to the logo (there is no additional symbol). A great example is Coca-Colaâ€™s red scripty type. Some people also refer to the logomark as the word portion of a logo that also has a symbol.</p>
