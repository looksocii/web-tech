    <h1>Programming language</h1>
    <p>A programming language is a formal language which comprises a set of instructions used 
        to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used to create programs 
        that implement specific algorithms. Most programming languages consist of instructions 
        for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, 
        rather than general programming languages. Early ones preceded the invention of the digital 
        computer, the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century 
        by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age.[1] Since the early 1800s, 
        programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music 
        boxes and player pianos.[2] The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) 
        did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.</p>

        <h1>C</h1>
        <p>C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured 
            programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents 
            many unintended operations. C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to 
            be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler to provide low-level access to 
            memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with 
            minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed 
            to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with 
            portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating 
            systems with few changes to its source code. The language is available on various platforms, 
            from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.</p>

        <h1>Python</h1>
        <p>Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. 
            Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant 
            whitespace. Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. 
            Python 2.0, released 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection 
            system capable of collecting reference cycles. Python 3.0, released 2008, was a major revision 
            of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run 
            unmodified on Python 3. Due to concern about the amount of code written for Python 2, support for 
            Python 2.7 (the last release in the 2.x series) was extended to 2020. Language developer Guido 
            van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project until July 2018 but now shares his 
            leadership as a member of a five-person steering council.</p>

        <h1>Java</h1>
        <p>Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, 
            object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as 
            possible. The latest versions are Java 13, released in September 2019, and Java 11, a 
            currently supported long-term support (LTS) version, released on September 25, 2018; 
            Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 
            for commercial use, while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for 
            personal use up to at least December 2020. Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling 
            older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues. 
            Since Java 9 (and 10 and 12) is no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to immediately 
            transition to Java 11 (Java 13 is also a non-LTS option).</p>
